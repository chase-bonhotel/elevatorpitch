# Elevator Pitch Assignment - Chase Bonhotel
Hi, my name is Chase Bonhotel, and I am developing a much-needed productivity tool that will help students like me to keep track of their tasks and goals in a streamlined way. Many students like me find it difficult to keep track of what they need to do for each class and keep track of their goals such as grades and time management. For example, I have found it difficult to manage the time I need to spend on my asynchronous classes each day in order to keep up, and end up doing it all the day of or the day before it is due. By creating an integrated task and goal management system, I could keep track of the tasks I need to do for that class each week as well as manage my progress towards the weekly goal of completing all the tasks for that class.

Online learning has been around for a long time, but never has it been the main method for instruction in mainstream institutions like it is today. For this reason, many students and instructors are finding it difficult to adapt to this new method of education. I believe that such a tool would prove useful to many people around the world as we all learn and adapt to the changing circumstances of our time.

The main problem many of us have that makes it difficult to keep track of these things is that there is a lack of an integrated tool that can help us interface all the things in one place. There are plenty of note taking apps, plenty of habit tracking and goal tracking apps, and plenty of apps geared towards productivity for school. However, I have yet to find a tool that combines all these things together in a comfortable integration that would be usable by everybody. 

We all have our own solutions to these modern problems, but my software would make our changings lives easier. Note taking, goal and task tracking, grade tracking, and room for integration with many of the tools or concepts that we already use for productivity, what we really need is one platform.
